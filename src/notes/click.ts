/**
 * CLICK — circle, neutral ring (wakes 400 → 50), solid colour ball + growing core on the 50–950 shade scale.
 *
 * Timing feedback follows Cytus II's click (measured frame by frame): a dim
 * pre-roll — which is also what tells the next page apart from the current
 * one — then a late, accelerating core, a visible converging ring and a
 * blink right before the hit.
 *
 *  0.00–0.10  fade in
 *  0.00–1.00  size follows the fitted Cytus II S-curve (`tokens.sizeCurve.click`):
 *             a small dim spawn (0.32), one smooth slow-fast-slow growth into a
 *             +6 % peak at p 0.88 — together with the lead-in blink and the
 *             converging ring — then a smooth settle, exactly 1.0 (the hit
 *             pose) from p 0.976
 *  0.00–0.10  fade in; 0–0.40 the outer ring assembles from 3 arcs
 *  0.00–0.40  one flat ball: the core sits at 0.36, blended into the 700 shade —
 *             no internal motion to read
 *  0.40–0.85  shade split: the core is differentiated out (rises 700 → 400, true
 *             colour), the background sinks 700 → 800 (full, uncompressed
 *             contrast — ΔL ≈ 0.3 at the hit, as Cytus II)
 *  0.42–0.94  the core (already at 0.36 — barely moving early, stable) swells
 *             ease-in to 0.8·inner — most of the growth lands in the last third
 *  0.70–1.00  approach ring contracts *linearly in time* from 1.83 R onto the ring
 *             (≈ 0.08 R thick, ≤ 50 % opacity)
 *  0.86–1.00  double blink: a lead-in flash (0.86–0.89) then the final blink (0.92–1);
 *             the core flashes white twice — the ring's own width stays a stable
 *             build-only motion, settling exactly at p = 1
 *             (the hit pose is calm and full)
